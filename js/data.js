  parents: `Welcome to Summit BJJ. We understand that things on the mats may look weird, and this page is designed to give you an idea of what we believe, and what we hope your child will achieve here.

"Self-defence is not a set of techniques, it’s a state of mind and it begins with the belief that you are worth defending." Rorion Gracie

When we bring our children to learn self-defence, it isn’t always obvious what that means in practice. 

Self-defence is a highly personal journey that will involve different challenges for everyone. Something that may seem easy to one student may be out of reach for another. It is not wholly physical; in fact, the mental aspects of our training are where the most benefit can be found.

It is our goal to remember that failure is CRITICAL to the learning process. Students will fail often and sometimes in spectacular fashion. 

Learning must be broken down into small, understandable steps and it must be practiced consistently over time.

If we want the kids to continuously come to training, and fail frequently while practicing repetitively, then TRAINING MUST ALWAYS BE FUN.

Because the student’s mental skills are the focus here, we tailor the training to promote those.

We aim to foster:
	Improved self confidence
	Improved self-respect
    Improved respect for others
	Healthy relationships and communication
	Kindness
	Impulse control and discipline
	Learning skills
	Ability to set boundaries and make decisions
	Etc Etc.

These skills take years to master, and can sometimes be very large changes. Behavioural change is difficult and will happen slowly over time, with consistent practice.

The coaches here will try to do this with a “pull” teaching style. Positive reinforcement has been shown to be far more effective at engaging the types of change that we aim for. This means we will aim to have students attend many, many classes and make only a small change at any one time. This might be only a small piece of advice or a small behavioural intervention. For the physical practice we can let students experiment and play, and only correct a small part of a technique at any one time.
We will encourage behaviours or skills that are positive, and we will gloss over or sometimes downright ignore a behaviour that we would like to see stop. This may mean that a student may not be focussing right now, or that their technique may not be correct. Our goal is to help support children to grow into competent and confident humans in the future, and so we will gradually address those things over time. Obviously, there are exceptions to this for safety, or for students who have been training for a long time. As a student’s confidence grows the techniques we use can evolve as well.

For you as a parent, there are a some things that we ask you to remember:

The Kids training room is not competition.
	The Gracie family believed that Jiu Jitsu for children should be play. They created what can only be described as the best stable of Jiu Jitsu competitors in history. We agree with this. The students should feel like this is fun. Some days it will be more challenging, and at some points a student may feel claustrophobic, but it should never feel like they are fighting for their survival.
Please do not coach the students from the sidelines, or cheer them on as if it is competitive.

We are trying to steer the ship gradually.
	Unless we ask you to intervene with your child, or there is an urgent need, please do not try to correct their behaviour from the sidelines. Students have many things to think about and many voices can be distracting. We know the classes may look chaotic! Over time a student’s behaviour will gradually align with the group. Small children are allowed some chaos.

Consistency is Key.
	Please try to remember our approach. We ask that you don’t correct behaviours between rounds or after class. We encourage that you try to notice something positive and offer praise on that aspect. If they were kind, or helped another student. If they persisted, if they were very focussed. If they were having fun with their training partner. 

Technique will come naturally to them.
	If classes are fun, the learning is within their capability and students train consistently, they will get better at Jiu Jitsu very quickly. Children have amazing brains that learn very effectively. We try to let students experiment as much as possible and have fun trying to unravel the patterns of Jiu Jitsu. They will do whacky stuff, and some of it won’t work at all. Please do not try to correct the things that could be better. Encourage the cool and creative things, praise positive outcomes, but mainly praise effort and persistence.

If any of this doesn’t make sense, or if you or your child would like to ask any questions, please don’t hesitate to approach Brian or the coaching staff after class.

  students: `Summit kid’s warrior code:

Jiu Jitsu is a superpower, and I intend to use it for good. I am here to train my mind and body, and shape myself into the person I want to be.

In order to reach my potential as a complete warrior, I will always try to follow this code.

	I will show respect to the people I practice with, treat them with kindness and never put them down or criticise them. I will do my best to listen respectfully and focus.

	I will do my best to keep my training partners safe, and to remember that we are here to help each other learn.

	I will try to make sure that I have fun, and that my training partners do too.
 
	I will always try my best and hardest, and do my best not to give up.

	I know that I can only control myself, and I will do my best to keep doing the right thing even if someone else is not. I will never, ever use the things I learn to be a bully, only for safety and protection.

	I will make mistakes, and I will do my best to take responsibility for learning from them. But I promise to treat myself with the same kindness and respect I show to the people around me when I do, and to try to forgive other people when they make mistakes.

	I know that a warrior is disciplined, so I will use these same rules everywhere. At Jiu Jitsu, at school and at home.

If we all do these things together we can train hard, wrestle and have fun, and I will learn how to be a strong and confident grappler, and a strong and confident human.

  coaches: `Introduction:

For the most part, when parents bring a child to learn self-defence they are hoping for learned respect, improved self-esteem, improved confidence, higher levels of resilience, healthy relationships, boundaries etc. These are really awesome goals that bring a lot of joy to a person’s life in every area and it’s important that we look to foster these outcomes. 

The Summit approach to kids’ classes is underpinned by the idea that we need kids to keep coming back, as many times as humanly possible. The more times they attend a class, the more small, incremental lessons we can try to pass on. It means that we don’t have to try to cram masses of theory in or correct every detail or behaviour at once, which is helpful as attention spans vary wildly.

It is our belief that in order to get students to come to class, class has to be FUN. This means we try not to be too rigid, strict, and definitely not too competitive. The goal is to create confident, competent, healthy people in the long term which means we don’t have to fix everything right now. We can let the kids work on one little game or skill today and as long as they had fun, hopefully they will come back so we can build on it. 
Try to remember that for each student that next challenge will be different, and for some students it might just be getting on the mats for part of a class.


Basic Principles:

Whenever we are coaching a kids class our top goals are:

Have Fun! It is meant to be fun, both for you and the kids.

Keep students as safe as possible. Stick to exercises, drills or games that you are comfortable with especially when you are unsure of the student’s ability. There are times to experiment with new games or techniques but you might choose to wait until you have extra coaches or you have a more experienced cohort of students. People can be unpredictable, so this can be difficult. 

Try to stay patient. Some days the most you can hope for is that student will come back again, and for some students and stages that is a huge victory.

Use “pull” teaching (positive reinforcement) as much as possible. There are times where we need to draw attention to a behaviour or address an issue, but generally we want to encourage and praise any positive event that we would like to see repeated, and just ignore a behaviour that we would like to see stop (rather than criticise). This is sometimes easier said than done, but should always be the goal.

Try to be Flexible. Some students are competitive and will take have no issues throwing themselves into rolling on day one. Others might only watch or not want to participate in certain activities, try not to be too rigid.

Use, and trust, YOUR best Judgement. Everyone has different experiences and styles; no two classes are the same. Varied learning is a huge strength as long as we are consistent in the way we care for the student’s wellbeing and apply similar philosophy in our approach.

Basic structure:

there are no hard and fast rules about the activities or times breakdown of a class, but we do have a general structure that we try to aim for most of the time. This may not be achieved, and the needs and wants of the students, or your experience may mean that it is not observed closely or at all. You might choose to move things around, do them at different times, change or delete portions either before-hand, or in response to a question from a student. All of which is OK.

When I first started teaching in schools I found it very helpful to make a rough chart of the times that I would start or finish things. This allowed me to have a certain number of exercises in my mind or written down, and meant I could be prepared for a full hour. As I have slowly built up experience I usually change things based on the questions I get from students, and I find this a great way to keep them interested. Even so, I still have the fallback of a rough break down of each class so I don’t get stuck having to think of something. Everybody will find a different way to solve this problem.
I highly recommend getting together a rough class plan, even if it is only in your head. The following can be helpful for that.

<img src="../images/class-structure-base.png" alt="" width="300" height="450"/>

We are aiming to do the following:
Warm-up
Throwing/Stand-up
Ground Technique/wrestling
Questions
Game

warm-up:
variations of animal movements, lines (as in the adults’ classes), games or controlled wrestling games, sometimes light rolling, cartwheels, stretching, breakfalls, running, Lael’s Judo warmups are all great. You may have something in mind that ties into the drills you plan to run later, the kids may ask for a game, electric fence is often popular. Racing for the belts, tiger tails, wrestling from the knees for a pin. No wrong answers as long as it is fun, gets bodies moving and elevates the heart rate. This is a good time if you want to incorporate some strength exercises such as push ups or lunges. Try to make it age appropriate, for example in the little wombats we really only do animals, a game or an obstacle course.
Judo/wrestling/stand-up:
Each class we want to try to incorporate some stand up, consistency over time is the goal. From a self-defence standpoint this is pretty important, and the students love stand up. It is important to consider safety and experience levels. New students might just drill breakfalls and less kinetic throws, an example would be a controlled outside trip after some breakfall practice. More experienced students may be asked to work on judo throws that they know practice all of them with a partner of similar skill. You may teach a throw or trip, or a takedown. Try to consider and maintain safety for the students, going from standing up down to the floor comes with risks. You can use crashmats, or perhaps have newer students take turns doing the throw on a grey belt. The idea is not to get them competing against each other, but practicing some of their standup techniques with control. During this time you may choose to get the higher belts doing one for one, i.e. a bit more live, or even do some standup rounds if you feel that the skill level and their attention to their partners safety is adequate. You may also feel that the class is too large, inexperienced or un-focussed and omit the standup component altogether. In the wombat’s class this may be throwing the coaches, or each other if the students are experienced. Variations of the sumo game can also be fun.




Ground Technique/wrestling:
Again, we are aiming for this at every class. You might teach something and have them practice it, you might do positional rounds, it may be stations. Lately I have been doing positional rounds to start, followed by a question or showing a technique to help with something I notice students struggling with, followed by more rounds after practicing that small technique. We try to highlight that this is practice, and as much as possible remove the competitive elements. Students need to feel safe to make mistakes. Highlight the need to respect and care for our partner’s, and as new students develop a higher level of awareness of their partner they are able to roll with more intent. It can be helpful to carefully pair new students and contain the drills to a position, you may set stations so there are less people rolling at once to allow you to watch more closely. Rolling is really important, however keeping students safe can be challenging as you can’t see everything. In very new cohorts you might do very positional rounds or just drilling. If you have all grey belts it may be open to certain submissions and 5 minute rounds. For the wombats this will likely be contained to one of the wrestling games with the coaches (spider kid or crazy horse), or maybe the students play hold the giant on each other if you judge that appropriate.

Question time:
Before game time we are aiming to allow time for questions. This can be questions about what we learned today, something that happened on the mats, something that happened at school, a situation that happened with a friend, self-defence in general. Maybe about an exercise. It can pay to be cautious with students you don’t know, occasionally kids can say something very surprising or even confronting. If you know the students you are working with then opening the floor to questions can be a great way to connect with them and they are usually very respectful and engaged. If you don’t then you may not feel too comfortable to allow a discussion without setting some guardrails. It may be that you ask students to contain questions to the techniques of the day or Jiu Jitsu in general. In the wombats you might ask more leading questions to keep them on topic. “did anybody feel…”

Game:
This is just meant to be fun, and does not have to be Jiu Jitsu related in any way. Line tag, crab royale, shipwreck, robots, scarecrow tag, zombies, electric fence. Make it age appropriate (for example magic turtles instead of zombies for the little wombats) and fun. Most of the time the attention span is wearing out on at least some students by game time. Try to keep it fairly simple, make sure they are aware of each other’s safety and have fun with them. This is a really good time for you to strengthen bonds with play and they will usually respond really well to having you fully involved. Leaves a great impression on them and hopefully they go home with a smile.
One thing we try not to do too much is put students on teams in groups against each other, and no games involve picking teams. Games like zombies or shipwreck put all students against all other students, and games like robots put students against coaches. We believe this is good for the relationships within the group.
Question time and game time are closely related and pretty flexible, they are reasonably dynamic and you will probably move them around a lot. If you get no questions you may have extra game time, which is usually not too challenging. If you have an extended question you can choose to run a short game. The game is a good reward for the students, so we try not to skip it, but these last two areas are subject to a lot of variation.



Tips:
These aren’t gospel. Everyone has different experience and likes to do things differently. I found starting to teach a bit daunting, and so these are just some strategies that I have developed in my time in schools, which some people may find helpful.

Be prepared to make mistakes, it’s the only way we learn. Not every class is going to be what you wanted to deliver. If you are honest and open with students they tend to be very forgiving, as long as they trust you they will accept apologies or explanations or mistakes. Just do your best.

Make everything a game, as much as possible. If we can bring things back from the level of a competition we allow them to experience success and failure, but we can lower the stakes and help the students learn. Games are fun, games encourage experimentation, games reward innovation and make people smile. This should be the goal as much as possible. Gamify the rolling where you can, whatever you can think of.

Try to speak in low, calm tones. This can be very challenging on some days, but students seem to reflect your energy. If you are heightened, they tend to be heightened. Most of the time students will mimic your activity and energy. There are studies showing that a low calm voice causes a listener to become calmer.

Try to Listen and engage with the questions and comments that students make as much as possible, without getting too far down the rabbit hole. This is a great strategy to show the students that you are interested and care about their ideas. It also helps to keep the class in an area that the students want to be. It can be challenging to prevent a class being derailed by endless questions. Sometimes you might want to say “one more question before we move on”, or you might find another way to gently progress the group.

One of my favourite strategies is I try to never to shrug off or ignore a joke or silly question. The kids like to poke fun and have a laugh and might say something offhand, silly or joking in response to the class content. There is usually a grain of truth in whatever they are joking about, and so I try to acknowledge the humour and then address the truth in the comment. Often this allows the group to share a laugh, as well as learn something unexpected or funny.

Remember to encourage the things they do well, and highlight the effective things they are doing. This is regarding behaviour as well as Jiu Jitsu technique. Help them to build habits by showing them what worked in what they are doing so they can try to replicate it. It also helps them see that they are progressing.

Remind students not to compete with each other, to keep each other safe, and encourage them to make it fun for each other. We are a team after all. Even though Jiu Jitsu is an individual sport, it takes a team of people for us to get good at it. Without training partners who challenge us we can’t improve, and our goal should be to help my partner get better so they can push me to get better. 

Always be prepared to laugh at your own expense, but never at a student’s expense. 

Students are going to feel uncomfortable at times, we aim to help them understand that they are safe. Sometimes we need to verbalise this to students in different ways; don’t be afraid stop two students rolling so that you can highlight something or to make them safe if something is getting out of hand. We need some discomfort to grow, but this needs to be carefully controlled. Too much discomfort can prevent students participating.

Try to get involved in the games and exercises as much as possible. Participating helps to connect you with the students.

Remembering names is hard, but it is very good to practice as much as possible. There are lots of different strategies for this, it might help to find one that works for you.

Don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Classes don’t need to be perfect. Students are looking for pretty much the same things that adults do. Was it fun? Did the coach listen to me and make me feel good? Were the peer interactions friendly? Did I enjoy the games? Did I have some success somewhere? Did someone help me when I needed it? Small moments are very powerful for creating a good impression, it isn’t necessary to have 60 minutes of perfect Jiu Jitsu.

If you have lots of Jiu Jitsu experience you might find it very easy to deliver an hour off the cuff. If not, a lot of the stress can be alleviated by preparing something prior to coaching a class. It doesn’t have to be exhaustive, particularly if you teach or train techniques you are comfortable with. it definitely helps if you have at least some idea of what you want to progress through and the points you are aiming to hit. It might even help to set up a rough idea of how long you want to spend in an area, with some timestamps.

Don’t be afraid to throw your lesson plan in the bin if it isn’t working.
Don’t be afraid to stick to your lesson plan if it isn’t working.

We can all get tunnel vision when we are concentrating. Try to move around the room to each group or pair or student and give them your full attention while you are there. This can help to get a feel for what students are struggling with, which students are happy or unhappy, which personalities may not work well together. It also means you can give almost every student some personalised input at least once per class which helps with engagement.

Good questions are really good. If they catch your interest, they will probably catch other student’s interest. If a student has a great question it can be a good strategy to stop the class and let everyone see and hear, and maybe practice the response.
 
There may be times that you need to be stern, but never lose your temper. Students thrive on consistency. We are expecting them to make mistakes, and so to lose our temper when they do is not reasonable. That is not to say that we never show students that we are unhappy, but they need to trust that we still respect them and care. If a student is not able to anticipate our reactions or they are out of proportion it will reduce trust and make us ineffective. Most all of the “rules” I have come across have some exception, but I don’t think this one does.

A group is a really powerful motivator. We have evolved to want to fit in with a group. If we are faced with challenging student behaviour it can be a useful strategy to let the student know that their partner is waiting for them so they can practice, or that the group is trying to listen, or that we all have to wait while they are in the way etc. This can be done gently and without criticism, and can be a powerful invisible force that can help a student to follow the behaviour modelled by the group.

Responsibility is a powerful motivator. Reminding the grey belts that the white belts are watching to see how they act can tighten them up. Asking a student to help a newer student can instil a sense of responsibility that may help modify their behaviour with a positive force.

If someone has done something unsafe, rude or persistently disruptive you may need to have a discussion with them about it. I believe it is always better to find a way to do this as privately as possible. Take them to the side or speak to them after class. Calmly explain what was wrong, why it was an issue and what the correct behaviour is for next time (with reasons). If we give them the information and opportunity most students will be able to correct the behaviour, even if it takes multiple interventions.

With any change, behavioural or technical, try to remember that incremental change is more achievable and sustainable. Some students can process a lot of information, but most kids cannot. Try to address one thing at a time, and give small amounts of information at a time. It doesn’t need to be complicated. You might just teach a certain framing movement and then let students experiment with it in the rolling.

Humour is really good for helping to keep students interested, but be sparing with it. Overuse can result in distracted students.

Try to be consistent with your boundaries. The students will respect it and they will do better if they know what to expect and where the “sides” are. Try not to move the goalposts, and if you do, explain to them why and what happened to cause the change.

In an “active modality” like a Jiu Jitsu class, movement and exercise helps to make the students engaged and receptive to information. Studies have shown these types of classes are great for retention, as long as we pay attention to the timing of our messages during the class. 
The gold standard is to bring the energy (movement) up, then reduce the energy (calm the students down) and deliver important information in the period of lower activity. It is not always easy to do and takes a bit of practice, but it’s good to be aware of. You can ask the students to take a seat, and experienced students will change gears straight away (we are lucky like that). It might be helpful to get students to grab a drink and then return and sit, this can help them to calm their mind before a discussion.


Students are watching what we do to see if we are legit. We can say whatever we want but if our actions are not congruous then we lose credibility. Try to be authentic with the students. Be honest. They are small humans with personalities and they want to have an equitable relationship just like anyone else we would deal with. We need to model the behaviour and activity we want them to have, because that is the single most powerful tool we have in our arsenal.
